Replipy
=======

CouchDB Replication Protocol implementation in Python.

Goals
=====

- Understand how replication protocol actually works;
- Implement the peer: endpoint that may be bidirectional synced with CouchDB;
- Implement the replicator: service that runs the replication between two peers;
- First of all, this is tutorial project that aims to be simple and stupid,
  without ambitions to fit production requirements (may be later)
